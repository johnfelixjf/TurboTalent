          <ol start="" role="list">
            <li>
              Start with a Plan: Before diving into the job market, take some
              time to develop a plan. Research industries that interest you,
              consider the skills and experience you have to offer, and
              determine what types of positions align with your goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tailor Your Resume: A great resume is key to getting noticed by
              potential employers. Make sure to tailor your resume to the job
              you're applying for, highlighting your relevant skills and
              experience. Consider including any internships, volunteer work, or
              extracurricular activities that showcase your abilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilize Networking: Networking is a valuable tool for job seekers,
              especially recent college graduates. Attend job fairs, industry
              events, and connect with alumni from your school. Reach out to
              family and friends and let them know you're on the job market.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be Proactive: Don't just sit and wait for job opportunities to
              come to you. Be proactive and search for job openings, research
              companies you're interested in, and make connections with
              potential employers. Consider reaching out to recruiters, applying
              to entry-level positions, and considering internships or freelance
              work to build your portfolio.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare for Interviews: Once you land an interview, make sure
              you're prepared. Research the company, prepare answers to common
              interview questions, and practice your responses with a friend or
              family member. Dress professionally and arrive on time for the
              interview.
            </li>
            <li>
              Follow Up: After an interview, make sure to follow up with a
              thank-you email or letter. Reiterate your interest in the
              position, and thank the interviewer for their time. This can help
              keep you top of mind and showcase your professionalism.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay Positive: Job hunting can be a long and challenging process,
              but it's important to stay positive and persistent. Don't get
              discouraged by rejection or lack of response. Keep working on your
              skills, make connections, and continue to pursue opportunities
              that align with your goals.
            </li>
            {/* <li>
              Keep it concise: ATS systems prefer concise resumes that are easy
              to scan. Keep your resume to one or two pages and avoid lengthy
              paragraphs or sections.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include relevant information: ATS systems are designed to identify
              specific information on your resume, such as job titles,
              companies, and dates of employment. Make sure to include this
              information in a clear and concise manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a simple font: While using a unique font might make your
              resume stand out, it can be a hindrance in the ATS screening
              process. Stick to simple and commonly used fonts like Arial, Times
              New Roman, or Calibri.
